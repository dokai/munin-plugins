This is a little collection of Munin plugins I wrote. I don't imagine any of 
this will work perfectly for anyone other than me, but it's released under
the BSD license in case anyone finds it useful.

Actually, munin.py is a pretty cute micro-framework for writing other munin
plugins. That might be interesting to someone else.
